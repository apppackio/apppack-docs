# GitHub Deployment Tracking

AppPack can hook into [GitHub's Deployment Dashboard](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/viewing-deployment-activity-for-your-repository) so you can see what commits have been deployed to which environments and when. It will also provide a link to the build logs for that deployment in the AppPack dashboard.

To enable this functionality, add our [GitHub Application](https://github.com/apps/apppack-io) to your repo or organization. If added to the organization, it will work for all repos in your org that use AppPack.
