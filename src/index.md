# Introduction

AppPack is a suite of tools that creates an application platform-as-a-service similar to Heroku on your own AWS account.

It includes:

* A web dashboard at [https://dashboard.apppack.io](https://dashboard.apppack.io)
* A command-line interface, `apppack`
* Cloudformation templates used by the CLI to create the necessary resources at AWS
* A managed AWS EventBridge target which reacts to events in your AWS account

## Project Status

AppPack is being used in production and under active development. It is currently invite-only. If you're interested in getting access, join the waiting list at [https://apppack.io](https://apppack.io/#contact).
